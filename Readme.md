# Machine Learning - Coursera by Andrew Ng

This is my implementation of the equations and algorithms.
I wanted to do all the things myself because the provided files give some kind of abstraction which were creating confusion in understanding. So in this I do all the things in one file from data preprocessing to implementation.
Week 1.
Weelk 3.
Hope you like it.
